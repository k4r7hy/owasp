# Awesome Tools For Owasp Top 10 [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of hacking toolsssss.

## Preamble
This is a list of tools which are not included anywhere in the Owasp top 10 list. 

## How to use this list
Some items in this list could easily fit in more than one category, so to make sure you find what you're looking for please use `Ctrl + F` (or `Cmd + F` on macOS).

## Emoji
You will notice some items on this list have a :star2: next to them. Items with a :star2: represent the author's top pick for that category. This is an entirely opinionated rating from someone who doesn't know everything about every item on the list, so be sure to check out alternative options before assuming something is "the best". That said, I do explore and test every resource I add to this list wherever possible.

## Background Information
This is a list compiled by me. karthy.k
